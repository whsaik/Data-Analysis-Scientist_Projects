# Data Analysis for Uber in New York City
In this project, we are interested in studying the Uber in New York dataset.

In this notebook, we perform the following analysis:

- Analysis on rush hour in New York City
- Determine the day and month with highest number of trips
- Determine the Base that has most number of trips
- Cross Analysis
- Analysis of Location points and Spatial Analysis

# Data Information:
The dataset contains information about the Datetime, Latitude, Longitude and Base of each uber ride that happened in the month of July 2014 at New York City, USA

Date/Time : The date and time of the Uber pickup

Lat : The latitude of the Uber pickup

Lon : The longitude of the Uber pickup

Base : The TLC base company code affiliated with the Uber pickup

##### The Base codes are for the following Uber bases:
  - B02512 : Unter
  - B02598 : Hinter
  - B02617 : Weiter
  - B02682 : Schmecken
  - B02764 : Danach-NY

--> The globe is split into an imaginary 360 sections from both top to bottom (north to south) and 180 sections from side to side (west to east). The sections running from top to bottom on a globe are called longitude, and the sections running from side to side on a globe are called latitude.

--> Latitude is the measurement of distance north or south of the Equator.

--> Every location on earth has a global address. Because the address is in numbers, people can communicate about location no matter what language they might speak. A global address is given as two numbers called coordinates. The two numbers are a location's latitude number and its longitude number ("Lat/Long").
